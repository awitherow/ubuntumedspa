The combination of microdermabrasion and PRP helps to resurface the skin and remove dead skin cells while promoting rejuvenation and repair, leaving the skin plumper and tighter looking with improved clarity. The results of the Vampire Facial can be seen as a gradual improvement to skin texture and brightness that can last from any where from 6 months up to 2 years. Overall, the Vampire Facial is a safe and effective way to naturally revitalize the skin by tapping into the power of the patient's own blood platelets, and it's suitable for people with different skin types or conditions.",
